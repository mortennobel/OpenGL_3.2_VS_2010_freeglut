A simple OpenGL 3.2 and GLSL 1.50 example using Microsoft Visual Studio 2010, FreeGlut and GLEW
====================================

## Description

The world seems to need another simple OpenGL example running on Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 using FreeGlut and GLEW. The example is a port of https://github.com/beelsebob/Cocoa-GL-Tutorial, since that was the most simple example I could find. The example also uses source code from the book "Interactive Computer Graphics - A Top-Down Approach with OpenGL" by Edward Angel and Dave Shreiner (Sixth Edition, Addison-Wesley 2012) (source code can be found here: http://www.cs.unm.edu/~angel/BOOK/INTERACTIVE_COMPUTER_GRAPHICS/SIXTH_EDITION/CODE/ ).

## Installation

I assume that you have FreeGlut and GLEW installed.
